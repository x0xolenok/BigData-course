# PCA
Use the PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
Instructions for execution
1. You need to find a high-dimensional dataset yourself
2. Find the optimal parameters of the algorithm, give arguments in favour of the fact that they are really optimal
3. Write conclusions about the work of the algorithm, pay attention to the parameters discussed in the lecture and reveal the theoretical component

# Results 
```bash
Optimal number of components: 8
```
